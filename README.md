## Machine_Learning

A subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science called machine learning focuses on using data and algorithms to simulate how 
people learn, progressively increasing the accuracy of the system.
The majority of the time, machine learning algorithms are developed utilizing accelerated solution development frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.    

## Four basics of machine learning:
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Semi-Supervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
